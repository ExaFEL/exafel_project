The [STRUMPACK](http://portal.nersc.gov/project/sparse/strumpack/) library for solution of sparse and dense linear matrices can be built by running `STRUMPACK_build_deps.sh` followed by `STRUMPACK_build_shared.sh`. This is currently the preferred method for building the library, and will be used unless expressed otherwise. The dependencies will first be downloaded and built, after which `libstrumpack.so` will be built against these dependencies.

The scripts will create `strumpack_deps`, `strumpack_build` and `strumpack_downloads` directories. All required dependencies will first be downloaded into the `downloads` directory. Following this, they will then be unpacked into `deps`. Lastly, each dependency will be built, with the final installation going to the `builds` directory.
