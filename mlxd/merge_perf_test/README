This code allows to test the different algorithms for merging data using the new MPI versions of cxi.merge.
To perform the testing, modify the parameters in the run_specific_merge.sh file to suit required testing
parameters. To run the tests on dials/viper type:
nohup ./run_specific_test.sh &
The above shell script will execute in the background, calling do_specific_merge.sh and providing all the
chosen parameters. Running tail on the logfile in the current directory will allow to check the progress.
